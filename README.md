# Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Zomato restaurant data. The main objectives are to gain insights into customer preferences, identify factors influencing restaurant ratings, and provide valuable insights for restaurant owners and food enthusiasts.

## Data Source

The Zomato dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and it includes restaurant information, user reviews, location details, and more. Data preprocessing involved cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

## Key Findings

The EDA revealed several key insights, including:
- Distribution of restaurant ratings and the impact of location.
- Popular cuisines and their geographic distribution.
- Relationship between average cost for two people and restaurant ratings.
- Most reviewed and highly-rated restaurants.
